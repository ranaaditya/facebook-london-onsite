# Meta London Onsite Interviews

The number of interview rounds in the onsite (final round) varies according to the applicant to applicant, for me there were total 3 interview rounds :
1. Behavioural / Manager's round (known as JEDI Round in Facebook)
2. Coding round
3. Coding round

## JEDI Round
This round mainly revolve around the **situation based problems**, usually a manager from an engineering team take your interview. You can think about it as a Rapid fire round with some situations that you can face while working in an engineering team (non-technical). You can take referrence from the resources, but questions varies according to the interviewer.

Take good sleep and chill !

## Coding Rounds
Total 2 coding rounds were there, one by WhatsApp Engineer and other by Networking Technical Lead.

Few observations:
- You will get 15 mins to solve a problem (told by my recruiter and that's fukin true) 
- Don't waste time in telling / going from naive to best approach, as this gonna waste your time and you have limited time :'(
- Take sometime to think about the problem, incase you are going blank or getting nervous (or even don't know the brute force) tell your interviewer, he/she will help you out by giving some hints
- In the onsite level rounds interviewers are less interested into language based implementations rather they are more interested into the algorithms you are using to solve the problem or how you are solving or any particular observation / pattern you find
- Think about the corner / edge cases where your solution might fail
- Tell the Time and Space Complexity after solving the problem


### Interview Topics
I am not allowed to reveal the actual questions !

Most of the interview questions were of Leetcode Hard level problems :)
