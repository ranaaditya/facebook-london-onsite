## Technical Screening Round

This technical Screening round consists of 2 coding questions - one easy to medium level and one from medium to hard level.

Interview took place online on zoom and there were 2 interviewers one was taking screening and other was observing it.

#### Tips to ace online technical screening:
- Be active during the interview
- ask all your clarifications / doubts about the interview question
- tell your approach to the interviewer along with time and space complexity and ask if you can start coding or not
- Dry run your code before getting started with code part and test your code with same / different test case(s)
- Explain everything like you are telling to you 5year old sibling
- Be ready for the Edge / Corner cases where your code can be failed (interviewer will ask this for sure)
- technical Screening rounds are not that much hard what people think about it, do atleast Standard Coding Questions and basic implementation of basic algorithms and data-structures should be handy
- Focus more on Arrays, Strings, LinkedList, Trees, Graphs, BFS, DFS.
